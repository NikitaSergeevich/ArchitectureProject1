 *
 * Description:
 * This class serves as a template for creating a main thread that will instantiate and connect a
 * set of filters. The details of the filter operations is totally self contained within the
 * filters, the "plumber" takes care of starting the filters and connecting each of the filters
 * together. The details of how to connect filters is taken care of by the FilterFramework. In order
 * to use this template the program should rename the class. The template includes the runFilter()
 * method which is executed when the filter is started. While simple, there are semantics for
 * instantiating, connecting, and starting the filters:
 *
 * Step 1: Instantiate the filters as shown in the example below. You should create the filters
 * using the templates provided, and you must use the FilterFramework as a base class for all
 * filters. Every pipe and filter network must have a source filter where data originates, and a
 * sink filter where the data flow terminates.
 *
 * Step 2: Connect the filters. Start with the sink and work backward to the source. Essentially you
 * are connecting the input of each filter to the up-stream filter's output until you get to the
 * source filter. Filter have a connect() method which accepts a FilterFramework type. This method
 * connects the calling filter's input to the passed filter's output. Again the example in the
 * comments below illustrates how this is done.
 *
 * Step 3: Start the filters using the start() method.
 *
 * Once the filters are started this main thread dies and the pipe and filter network processes data
 * until there is no more data movement from the source. Each filter will shutdown when data is no
 * longer available (provided you follow the read semantics described in the filter templates). on
 * their input ports.
 *
 * Parameters: None
 *
 * Internal Methods: None
